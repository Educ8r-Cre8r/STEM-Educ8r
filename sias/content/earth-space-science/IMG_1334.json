The squirrel has gray and brown fur with a big bushy tail. You can see it holding the food in its small paws. Around the squirrel are green plants and flowers growing in the dark brown soil. The squirrel is sitting right in the garden dirt, which shows how animals interact with Earth materials!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates how animals interact with and affect soil and Earth materials. Squirrels are important soil engineers! When they dig to bury nuts and seeds, they mix and aerate the soil, bringing nutrients from deeper layers to the surface. They also help with seed dispersal - many buried nuts are never recovered and grow into new trees. The dark, rich soil in this garden is full of organic matter (decomposed plant and animal materials) mixed with mineral particles from weathered rocks. Healthy soil is actually a mixture of rocks, minerals, water, air, and living organisms - it's not just dirt!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Soil Composition**: Soil is made of weathered rock particles, organic matter (dead plants and animals), water, air, and living organisms.\n\n2. **Soil Layers**: Earth's surface has layers of soil with different properties, formed over long periods of time.\n\n3. **Bioturbation**: When animals dig, burrow, or move through soil, mixing and changing its structure.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Soil Separation\" investigation! Fill a clear jar halfway with soil, add water to nearly fill it, put on the lid, and shake vigorously. Let it settle for 24 hours. Layers will form: rocks and sand at bottom, silt in middle, clay and organic matter on top. Students draw and label the layers. Discuss: Why did materials separate? What makes up soil? This visual demonstration makes soil composition concrete and memorable!\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Hands-On Exploration**: Let students examine different soil samples with magnifying glasses\n- **Texture Comparison**: Compare sandy soil, clay soil, and loamy garden soil\n- **Living Soil**: Search for soil organisms (worms, insects, roots) in safe outdoor areas\n- **Soil Profiles**: Show images or create models of soil layers\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-ESS2.A]]: Earth Materials and Systems\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS2.A]]: Earth Materials and Systems  \n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS2.A]]: Earth Materials and Systems\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems]]: Understanding soil as a system of materials and organisms\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What Earth material is the squirrel sitting on? (DOK 1: Recall)\n2. What do you think soil is made of? (DOK 1: Recall)\n3. How do animals like squirrels help change and mix the soil when they dig? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n4. Why is soil important for plants and for humans? (DOK 3: Strategic Thinking)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Soil**: The mixture of weathered rock, organic matter, water, and air at Earth's surface\n- **Organic matter**: Material from dead plants and animals that decomposes in soil\n- **Weathering**: The breakdown of rocks into smaller particles that become part of soil\n- **Minerals**: Natural solid substances from rocks that make up part of soil\n- **Erosion**: The movement of soil from one place to another\n\n## 🌱 Extension Activities\n\n- Investigate what happens to soil during erosion and how to prevent it\n- Research earthworms and their role in creating healthy soil\n- Create a soil profile showing different layers (horizons)\n- Compare soil samples from different locations (forest, desert, garden)"
