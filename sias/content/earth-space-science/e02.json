In the foreground on the left, you can see a large house with a red tile roof surrounded by green trees and vegetation. In the distance, a city skyline is visible but very unclear - it's partially obscured by thick haze or fog. The buildings in the background look faint and gray. The entire scene has a misty quality showing how particles in the air can reduce visibility.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates atmospheric haze and how particles in the air affect visibility. Haze forms when tiny particles of dust, smoke, pollution, or water droplets scatter and absorb sunlight in the atmosphere. Unlike fog (which is water droplets), haze is often a mixture of dry particles and moisture. The hazy appearance tells us about air quality - more particles mean more haze and reduced visibility. In urban areas, haze can result from vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, or natural causes like dust. The way distant objects appear faded shows how Earth's atmosphere affects light - the farther away something is, the more air its light must travel through to reach our eyes.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Atmosphere**: The layer of gases and tiny particles surrounding Earth that we breathe and live in.\n\n2. **Air Quality**: How clean or polluted the air is, affected by natural and human-made particles.\n\n3. **Visibility**: How far we can see clearly, which is reduced by particles suspended in the air.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate an \"Air Particles\" demonstration! Fill two clear jars with water. Leave one clear. In the second, add a few drops of milk or stir in cornstarch. Shine a flashlight through both jars from behind. Observe: Which lets more light through? In which can you see clearly? Discuss: How is this like haze in the atmosphere? Students draw diagrams showing how particles scatter light. This hands-on model makes invisible air particles and their effects visible and understandable!\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Visibility Tracking**: Photograph the same distant landmark on clear vs. hazy days\n- **Air Quality Index**: Check local air quality reports and discuss what they mean\n- **Particle Collection**: Use sticky paper to collect airborne particles (examine with magnification)\n- **Comparison Photos**: Show clear day vs. hazy day images of the same location\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS2.D]]: Weather and Climate\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS2.A]]: Earth Materials and Systems\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS3.C]]: Human Impacts on Earth Systems\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause]]: How particles in air cause visibility changes\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. Why can't we see the city clearly in this photo? (DOK 1: Recall)\n2. What is the layer of gases and particles around Earth called? (DOK 1: Recall)\n3. How do particles in the air affect how far we can see? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n4. What are some natural and human-made sources of haze? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Haze**: Reduced visibility caused by particles suspended in the atmosphere\n- **Atmosphere**: The layer of gases surrounding Earth\n- **Air quality**: A measure of how clean or polluted the air is\n- **Particles**: Extremely small pieces of solid matter or liquid droplets\n- **Visibility**: The distance at which objects can be clearly seen\n\n## 🌫️ Extension Activities\n\n- Research the difference between fog, haze, smog, and mist\n- Investigate how air quality affects human health and the environment\n- Track daily air quality index readings in your area for a month\n- Study how weather conditions (wind, rain) can clear or worsen haze"
