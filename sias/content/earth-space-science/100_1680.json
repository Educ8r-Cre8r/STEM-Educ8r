Behind it you can see snow-covered evergreen trees and a big bare tree without leaves. The snow is thick and white, blanketing everything - the wagon, the ground, and the trees. It's a peaceful winter scene that shows how snow transforms the landscape!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates precipitation in the form of snow and seasonal weather patterns. Snow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes into ice crystals instead of falling as rain. This happens when air temperature is below 32°F (0°C) all the way from the cloud to the ground. Each snowflake is a unique ice crystal! Snow acts as an insulator - it traps air between the flakes, which is why it helps protect plants underneath from extreme cold. Notice how the evergreen trees keep their needles while the deciduous tree has lost all its leaves - this is an adaptation to winter conditions.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Precipitation**: Water falling from clouds in forms like rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n2. **Freezing Point**: The temperature (32°F or 0°C) at which water changes from liquid to solid (ice).\n\n3. **Seasonal Changes**: Regular patterns of weather that occur throughout the year as Earth orbits the Sun.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"States of Water\" demonstration! Show water in three states: ice cubes (solid), water in a cup (liquid), and steam from hot water (gas). Use a thermometer to measure temperatures. Discuss: At what temperature does water freeze? When does it melt? Extension: If possible, catch snowflakes on dark paper and examine with magnifying glasses before they melt. Photograph them quickly! This hands-on investigation makes water's phase changes concrete and observable.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Temperature Tracking**: Graph daily temperatures during winter months\n- **Snow Measurement**: If in snowy climate, measure snowfall and track accumulation\n- **Photo Comparison**: Compare same location in different seasons\n- **Water Cycle Connection**: Show how snow is part of Earth's water cycle\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS2.D]]: Weather and Climate\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-ESS2.D]]: Weather and Climate\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]]: Structure and Properties of Matter\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Recognizing seasonal weather patterns\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What form of precipitation is covering the wagon and trees? (DOK 1: Recall)\n2. What temperature must it be for precipitation to fall as snow instead of rain? (DOK 1: Recall)\n3. Why do you think the evergreen trees still have their needles while the big tree is bare? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n4. How does snow help protect plants and animals during winter? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Snow**: Frozen precipitation that falls as ice crystals\n- **Precipitation**: Water that falls from clouds (rain, snow, sleet, hail)\n- **Freezing point**: The temperature at which water turns to ice (32°F/0°C)\n- **Seasonal**: Occurring during specific times of the year\n- **Insulation**: Material that prevents heat from escaping or entering\n\n## ❄️ Extension Activities\n\n- Research how snowflakes form and why each one is unique\n- Investigate different types of winter precipitation (snow, sleet, freezing rain, hail)\n- Create a timeline showing seasonal changes in your area\n- Study how animals survive winter (hibernation, migration, adaptation)"
