The water is a mix of gray and white, indicating a turbulent sea. The most prominent feature is the large splash of white water and sea spray erupting upwards as the wave hits the rocks. The foreground consists of a gravel or pebble-covered shore. The sky is a pale, overcast gray, suggesting a cool or windy day. The image shows the interaction between the water and the solid rock.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates the interaction between moving water and a solid surface, resulting in the transfer of kinetic energy. The large waves are a form of mechanical energy. When a wave hits a rock, its kinetic energy is transferred to the rock. This transfer causes the water to splash upwards and outwards, and it can also lead to erosion over time. The white color of the sea spray is due to air being trapped in the turbulent water, scattering light in all directions.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1\\.  **Energy Transfer:** The kinetic energy of the moving water is transferred to the rock upon impact. This energy can cause the rock to move slightly and is responsible for the splash and spray.  \n2\\.  **Mechanical Forces:** The force of the water moving against the rock is a mechanical force. This force is strong enough to break apart rocks over long periods, a process called erosion.  \n3\\.  **Properties of Matter:** The water is a liquid that flows and splashes. The rocks are solids that are hard and can be broken down by the force of the water. The interaction shows how different states of matter behave when they meet.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>  \nUse a simple simulation or model\\! Have students use a large bowl of water and a block of clay or a rock. They can push the object through the water to observe the splash and wave patterns. This hands-on model helps them visualize how the water's energy is transferred and how the shape of the object affects the splash.  \n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>  \n\\- **Visual Modeling:** Provide a diagram or video of a wave hitting a rock for students who need visual support.  \n\\- **Kinesthetic Learning:** Have students act out the roles of water molecules and rocks to understand energy transfer.  \n\\- **Sensory Exploration:** Play a recording of ocean waves crashing to help students connect the sound to the visual phenomenon.  \n\\- **Differentiated Materials:** Provide tactile models of waves and rocks for students to explore.  \n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n\\- [[NGSS:DCI:3-PS2.A]]: Forces and Motion  \n\\- [[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS2.A]]: Earth's Systems  \n\\- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy]]: Energy can be transferred in different ways  \n\\- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Observing patterns in natural events like erosion  \n\\- [[NGSS:PE:3-5-ETS1-1]]: Define a simple design problem involving forces and motion\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1\\.  What happened to the water when the wave hit the rock? (Bloom's: Recall) (DOK: 1)  \n2\\.  Why do you think the water splashed up so high? (Bloom's: Understand) (DOK: 2)  \n3\\.  How might the water hitting the rocks be like a hammer hitting a nail? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 3)  \n4\\.  What do you think will happen to the rocks over a very long time because of the waves? (Bloom's: Evaluate) (DOK: 4)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Energy:** The ability to make things move or change.  \n* **Force:** A push or a pull that can make something move.  \n* **Erosion:** The process of wearing away rock or soil by water, wind, or ice.  \n* **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of moving things.  \n* **Splash:** The sudden burst of liquid when something hits it."
