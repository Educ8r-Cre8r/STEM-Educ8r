The cicada's transparent wings are visible, revealing intricate vein patterns and slight color variations ranging from pale green to brownish hues. Dew droplets are scattered across the wings and branches, adding a glossy texture to the scene. The background is blurred, emphasizing the sharp focus on the cicada and its immediate surroundings.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the life cycle of a cicada, specifically highlighting its metamorphosis from nymph to adult. Cicadas spend most of their lives underground as nymphs, feeding on sap from plant roots. When they emerge, they undergo a remarkable transformation, shedding their exoskeleton (a process called molting) to reveal their wings and adult form. The dew droplets in the image also illustrate surface tension, a property of water that allows it to form droplets rather than spreading out flat.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Metamorphosis**: The process of transformation from an immature form (nymph) to an adult, involving significant changes in structure and function.  \n2. **Exoskeleton**: A hard outer covering that provides support and protection for insects like cicadas.  \n3. **Surface Tension**: The elastic tendency of a liquid surface, which allows it to resist an external force.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>  \nEngage students with a hands-on activity: Observe live or recorded images of cicada molting. Ask them to compare the nymph and adult stages, focusing on differences in structure (e.g., wings, legs). Use a magnifying glass to examine the exoskeleton's texture and discuss its role in protection.  \n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>  \n- Provide tactile models or 3D prints of cicada nymphs and adults for students to compare.  \n- Offer visual aids like time-lapse videos of molting to support understanding.  \n- Use analogies (e.g., comparing molting to shedding skin) to make abstract concepts more relatable.  \n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.A]]: Developmental Biology  \n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]: The role of molting in cicada development.  \n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]: How the exoskeleton supports survival.\n\n**Performance Expectations:**  \n- 3-LS1-1: Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but share common patterns of growth and development.  \n- 5-ESS2-1: Develop a model to explain the Earth's internal and surface processes.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What changes do you observe between a cicada nymph and an adult? (Bloom's: Compare) (DOK: 2)  \n2. How does the exoskeleton help a cicada survive in its environment? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 3)  \n3. Why might dew droplets form on the wings of a cicada? (Bloom's: Evaluate) (DOK: 1)  \n4. What role does molting play in the life cycle of a cicada? (Bloom's: Explain) (DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Metamorphosis:** The process of transformation from an immature form to an adult.  \n- **Exoskeleton:** A hard outer covering that supports and protects an insect's body.  \n- **Surface Tension:** The property of water that allows it to form droplets.  \n- **Nymph:** The immature stage of an insect, such as a cicada, before it becomes an adult.  \n- **Molting:** The process of shedding an exoskeleton to grow or develop.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n- **For Support:** Provide a diagram comparing the life stages of a cicada with labels. Use simple language to describe each stage.  \n- **For Extension:** Research how other insects undergo metamorphosis and compare their life cycles to that of a cicada.  \n- **Cross-Curricular Link:** Explore how cicadas are represented in myths or stories from different cultures.\n\n## 🌍 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**  \n- *The Very Quiet Cricket* by Eric Carle  \n- *Cicadas: Insects of the Summer* by Bobbie Kalman\n\n**YouTube Videos:**  \n- *The Life Cycle of a Cicada*, National Geographic Kids (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example)  \n- *Cicada Molting Time-Lapse*, Science Channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example)  \n",
