You can see its four legs spread out with tiny toes gripping the wood, and its long tail helps it balance. The lizard's eye is visible, and it appears to be basking in the sun. The wood has interesting textures and cracks that the lizard uses to hold on.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates thermoregulation - how reptiles control their body temperature. Unlike mammals and birds that make their own body heat, lizards are ectothermic (cold-blooded). They must warm up by basking in sunny spots and cool down by moving to shade. Morning sunshine on a fence post is perfect for a lizard to raise its body temperature so it can move quickly to catch insects. The lizard's dark coloring helps absorb heat from the sun faster!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Ectothermic**: Animals that rely on external heat sources (like the sun) to warm their bodies instead of producing heat internally.\n\n2. **Basking Behavior**: When reptiles sit in sunny spots to absorb heat and raise their body temperature for activity.\n\n3. **Toe Pads and Grip**: Many lizards have specialized toe structures with tiny scales or pads that help them climb vertical surfaces like fences and trees.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a temperature experiment! Place thermometers in different locations around the schoolyard (sunny pavement, shady grass, inside a box, under a rock). Record temperatures every hour. Discuss: Where would a lizard go to warm up? Cool down? Students can create a \"lizard's daily schedule\" showing movement between hot and cool spots. This makes thermoregulation concrete!\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Hands-On Exploration**: Let students feel dark vs. light fabrics in sunlight to understand heat absorption\n- **Movement Integration**: Have students act out lizard behavior - basking, running, seeking shade\n- **Visual Charts**: Create a day-in-the-life timeline showing when lizards are active vs. resting\n- **Technology Support**: Use thermal imaging if available to show temperature differences\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.A]]: Structure and Function\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]]: Adaptation\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.D]]: Social Interactions and Group Behavior\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems]]: Understanding how organisms interact with their environment\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. Why is this lizard sitting on the sunny fence instead of in the shade? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n2. How are lizards different from mammals like dogs and cats in the way they control body temperature? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n3. What do you think this lizard does on a very hot summer afternoon when the fence gets too hot? (DOK 3: Strategic Thinking)\n4. Why might lizards be more active on warm, sunny days than on cool, cloudy days? (DOK 2: Skill/Concept)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Ectothermic**: An animal that gets its body heat from external sources like the sun\n- **Thermoregulation**: The process of controlling body temperature\n- **Basking**: Sitting in a warm place, especially sunlight, to absorb heat\n- **Reptile**: A cold-blooded animal with scales, like lizards, snakes, and turtles\n- **Diurnal**: Active during the day (when the sun provides warmth)\n\n## 🦎 Extension Activities\n\n- Compare ectothermic (lizards, snakes, turtles) vs. endothermic (mammals, birds) animals\n- Investigate how desert lizards avoid overheating\n- Create a graph showing lizard activity levels throughout the day based on temperature\n- Research seasonal changes in lizard behavior (winter brumation)"
